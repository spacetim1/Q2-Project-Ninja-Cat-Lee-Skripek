## By Timothy Lee & Andrew Skripek
###### This project is based on the game Math Ninja, an old mobile game where you have to solve math problems and shoot the incoming enemies with a ninja star.
###### This project took the shooting at the oncoming enemies part.
###### The main goal of the game is to kill 20 bears (enemies) before they can reach you and kill you.
